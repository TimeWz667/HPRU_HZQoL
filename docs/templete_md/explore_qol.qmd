## Data of HRQoL

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(targets)

setwd("H:/Working/Analyses/HPRU_HZQoL")

data_qol <- tar_read(data_qol, 2)

head(data_qol)
```

### Data description

There are three clear clustering in the EQ5D scores

```{r}
hist(data_qol$EQ5D)
```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{}
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{}
```
